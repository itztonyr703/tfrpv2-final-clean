# qb-vendings
for qbcore fivem 


may have to change 
```    ['candy'] = {
        ['Label'] = 'Candy',
        ['Items'] = {
            [1] = {
                ['name'] = "chocolate",
                ['price'] = 4,
                ['amount'] = 50,
                ['info'] = {},
                ['type'] = "item",
                ['slot'] = 1,
            },
        }
    },```  change "chocolate" to somthing else from your  qb-core sheared as if its not changed and you dont have "chocolate" in your sheared  then it will give a error  :)

# wasabi_boombox 2.1

This resource was created as a ESX/QB free portable boombox script capable of playing youtube links.

**UPDATE:**
This is 2.0 of wasabi_boombox and no longer requires nh-context/keyboard unlike my previous version (It utilizes ox_lib).
Previous bugs such as boomboxes duplicating, falling over, and songs not stopping should be resolved with this version moving forward as well as additional new features.

<b>Features:</b>
- Usable boombox
- Full animations and boombox prop
- Ability to save songs for later use
- Play any youtube song
- Adjust volume
- Stop music on boombox pick-up
- Play music truly anywhere
- Uses 0.00ms on idle and 0.01ms~ when boombox prop attached to hand

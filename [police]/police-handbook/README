# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

This modification implements a British Police Handbook into FiveM (Server Side). The command /handbook is used to display a list of commands in the handbook. Hours of training can be done to teach individuals, but a plugin like this is needed to ensure those standards are not forgotten!

This will improve roleplay quality on British policing servers with prompts such as GOWISELY (Stop & Search) easily appearing as a notification on your screen. Similarly, /arrest will prompt the full caution and /nec will list all necessities for an arrest.

/arrest - Arrest Format
/handbook - List all Commands
/nec - PACE (Code G) - Necessities
/tor - Traffic Offence Report
/methane - Major Incident Declaration
/ipp - Initial Phase Pursuit
/pic - s136 Mental Health Act
/ic - Identity Codes (eg, IC1/IC2)
/wm - Warning Markers (eg, FI)
/book - Cell Space Booking Format
This modification is complete however updates will be published in the future improving the amount of commands and features. No bugs identified currently.

Installation:
FiveM: (Server side)
1. Drag and drop the “policehandbook” folder into your server directory > cfx-server-data-master > resources.
2. In "server.cfg” add a new entry: “start policehandbook”, this will start the resource.

Drag and drop the “policehandbook” folder into your server directory > cfx-server-data-master > resources.
In “server.cfg” add a new entry: “start policehandbook”, this will start the resource.
In the future I plan to develop more British related content similar to the mod seen here, which will improve realism for British players!

Features include custom external sounds, taser interface (CID) notifications, taser cartridge limit, taser reload functionality, taser safety mode, taser arc mode, taser cartridge reactivation, barb removal and distance based "ripping out".

## Functions
**External Taser Sounds:**
We've included three realistic, custom taser sounds to enhance the whole experience. These are a discharge trigger sound, drive stun/arc sound and reactivation. These have been taken from Youtube videos.

**Taser Cartridge Limit:**
Your Taser X2 will automatically fire the left cartridge, then the right before requiring you to reload. You also carry 2 spare cartridges so use them wisely! You will still be able to fire other weapons without reloading.

**Taser Reload System:**
You can quickly reload your taser using /rt either reloading one or two cartridges into the available slots.

**Axon Audit Trail (Discord Integration):**
Like with real life, we've introduced Discord integration logging every Taser action. This will make use of force more accountable for your server.

**Taser Reactivation:**
After firing either Cartridge 1 or Cartridge 2, you'll have the ability to either reactivate just one of them, or both using PageUP and PageDOWN. This provides an exceptional ability to handle a situation, previously not possible. Your taser does not even have to be pointing at them to reactivate, however don't move away, the barbs will rip themselves out!

**Taser Drive Stun/Arc Mode:**
This can be performed even with no cartridges loaded into the taser by pressing E, there is a 5 second cooldown between drive stun actions.

**Taser Safety Mode:**
If you won't be using your taser any time soon, you can put it into safety mode using /ts. You'll still be able to deploy other weapons whilst in safety mode.

**Barb Removal:**
After deploying Taser on a suspect, you'll need to remove the barbs. This can be done with /rb1 (Remove Barbs for cartridge 1), or /rb2 (Remove barbs for cartridge 2). After removing barbs you will no longer be able to reactivate them. Please note, barbs will "rip out" automatically if you move over 30m away.

**Taser CID Interface (Notifications):**
You'll get in-game notifications above the map showing your cartridges left, taser mode and more!

Overall, we hope these features increase realism and provide a host of new opportunities for Taser armed officers. We look forward to seeing screenshots, videos and more in our Discord server of you using the plugin and any feedback you have!
